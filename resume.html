The main purpose of IRS is to collect vital performance statistic ( network, CPU, paging, disk usage, disk I/O activity, DB2 space usage) from every host and present it by way of graphs and tables via WEB site. The IRS consists of two main components: the Back End Collector and HTML/Graph-generating Front End. The Collector has local subsystem on every server to collect and keep daily statistics and central repository subsystem which provided data transfer, validation and data housekeeping on WEB-server host. The Front End was implemented as set of CGI-scripts based on Perl, GD.pm and GIFgraph.pm. The IRS became a very important tool for performance monitoring, early problem detection and analysis of historical data. The further enhancements included DB2 table space usage monitoring, graphical forecast of potential table space exhaustion and early email alarm of DB2 administrator. The system had been developed using only Open Source software: Linux, Apache Server, Perl, GD, GIFgraph, which resulted into low development cost.

Since the conversion must be provided step-by-step on monthly basis during the whole year 1999 (due to gradual conversion of Coopers offices), the production deployment routine also had to be provided and well planned.

<ul><span> </span>Migration of Sapiens system from Mainframe to Unix
Participated and successfully completed the most important project carried out in the company last years. The main software product of the company (4GL RDBMS/Application Generator) written in Assembler-370 had to be migrated from IBM Mainframe to Unix platform (IBM-RISC-6000). The translation from Assembler to C-language was the only way to solve this problem. The majority of modules were translated, except API-modules which were to be rewritten manually to comply to Unix standards. I have contributed: 
  <li>ASM-to-C compiler development (About 10000 lines of C and parser grammars).</li>
  <li>RDBMS (c tree) to handle cross-reference and symbol tables.</li>
  <li>DB API development to port to databases.</li>
  <li>Portability analysis.</li>
  </ul>
